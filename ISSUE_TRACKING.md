## Known Issues
- Dead chat wont move to the bottom after renaming

## WIP
- Add specific ordering of channels
- Make it so spectators and dead roles cannot react in non-dead chat
- Make a wolf.speed command
- Alphabetize journals
- Dockerize the bot for AWS deployment

## Nice to Haves
- Allow user to rename their own journal (This allows it so mods dont need to change it all the time)
