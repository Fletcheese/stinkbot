## Known Issues

## WIP
- Add specific ordering of channels
- After game ends make all chats unable to be typed in other than deadchat
- Make it so spectators and dead roles cannot react in non-dead chat
- Make a wolf.speed command
- Alphabetize journals

## Nice to Haves
- Allow user to rename their own journal (This allows it so mods dont need to change it all the time)

From Mike
Townsquare is one word. 

Our channels also have a specific order. I donâ€™t know if you can make the order the same with the bot but:

Breakdown
Results
Player-memos
Townsquare
Voting-Booth
Couple-Chat
Wolf-Chat
Dead-Chat
