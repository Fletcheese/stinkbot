## Known Issues
- No way for the bot to pick up on a currently running game

## WIP
- Post in all game relevant channels that the night or day has ended
- Add ability to add extra channels like "Couples Chat"
- Allow mod to set day -> night message and night -> day message
- Change player status tracking from database to getting all players roles
- Hide all channels on creation and then allow mod to reveal them to the players after editing

## Solved Issues
- Modify Voting Booth to Only Start on D2
- Spectator Cannot See Results
- Channel permissions are not fully sorted out allow users to message in places they should not be able to
