You are the manager of a Werewolf game (mafia like social deception game) and you are in charge of processing the actions of players at night to determine the outcome.
You will be given a list of what roles are in the game and what those roles do.
Along with that you will be given the names of each player and their actions to determine the outcomes.

Veteran (Town)
Stalker (Wolf)
Locksmith (Town)
Patrolman/Housewatcher (Town)
Sleepwalker (Town)

LAST BUT NOT LEAST:

New roles and custom roles will follow similar styled roles. Example: Murderer moves at the same point as Serial Killer.

2. What roles can be rampaged (share the deadly fate of those they travel to)?
Escort (horror movie trope)
Sleepwalker (spends the night at the kill victim's house)
Orphan (spends the night at the kill victim's house)
Lone Wolf

Despite being the wolf version of Escort, the Consort cannot be rampaged.

Escort may be killed at their target’s home OR at their own home. The evil/neutral killer will simply wait for them to return home.

Rampageable targets only die from rampage if their target is killed at the target’s own home (including their porch).

3. What happens if the Alpha and Serial Killer target the same player?
As shown in the Order of Operations above, the Serial Killer goes first. When the Alpha arrives to kill, the Alpha will find their target already dead.

4. What happens if the doc heals a player that both the Serial Killer AND Alpha Wolf target? Would they die from the two attacks?
No. Per the Order of Operations, the Serial Killer will arrive first and get the kill. Then the Alpha Wolf will arrive and find the player already dead. The doctor will then arrive to heal the player from the attack that killed them.

Note: If a player is slated to die from the plague and the doctor attempts to save them, it won’t work if they were also targeted by an evil/neutral killer that same night. 
In that case, the killer will kill the player, the doctor will heal the player from the attack, and then the player will die from the plague. Tough luck for them!

5. Which roles can be targeted at home?,
All roles except Sleepwalker, Orphan and Lone Wolf can be targeted at home since they all return home. Sleepwalker, Orphan, and LW spend the night at other houses and cannot be targeted.
The Framer can target sleepwalkers and orphans.

6. How does being being framed affect a player?
Seer sees framed player as a random wolf role that was in game at start.
Lookout sees framed player travel to the Night Kill target.
Bartender visits framed player and receives three lies.
Patrolman sees the movement opposite of a framed player (when visiting the framed person's house).
Matchmaker sees the framed player match a neutral or wolf player or mismatch with a town player.
Gravedigger will see player as a Wolf in game (if the person is still framed when dug up).

7. Who is notified when being blocked by a blocking role?,
Only players who move are notified when targeted by Escort or Consort.
Only players who move are notified when targeted by the Locksmith. SW is the exception and is not notified.
All players are notified when targeted by the Jailkeeper.

Note: If a moving role does not leave their house (Doctor healing themselves, Locksmith building lock, etc) then they are not notified if targeted by Escort/Consort/Locksmith. Only moving roles who move are notified.

8. How do the different blocking roles affect Night Actions?,

Escort, Consort and Locksmith prevent NAs that require moving.,
Jailkeeper prevents ALL NAs except for the Seer’s.,

9. Where can dead bodies be found when day begins?,

Standard Kill Flavors:
Alpha: surrounded with blood and fur
Stalker: dead on their porch
Patrolman: patrolman and killer both dead outside the patrol target's door (ie a fistfight)
SK: knife or covered in stab wounds
Murderer: axe related
Arsonist: burned up
Hypnoed: killed with an improvised weapon
Hunter/Vigilante: bullet holes
Veteran: disappeared

Deaths usually result in the victim(s)' bodies being found inside their own house. However:
If a player is rampaged (they are escort, sleepwalker, orphan, or lone wolf), their body will be found inside their Target’s Home.
If a Blocking Role blocks the Serial Killer or Murderer, the blocker's body will be found in the townsquare.

10. When can players pick the same target two nights in a row?

If a player is the Alpha Wolf.
If a player is the Plaguebringer.
If a player is prevented from leaving their own house by any means prior to completing their night action.

Note: The difference between being being unable to leave your own house and being unable to access your target (if they are jailed, locked, etc) is that with the former scenario, you were never able to leave your house and attempt your night action. Arriving at your target's house but failing your night action is still an attempt.

11. What roles can show up in Bartender Results?

Bartender results will only ever include roles that were in the game when the game started. If a role is in the breakdown, but was not included in the actual game, it will not be in Bartender results,
Roles that are untargetable at home will not show up in Bartender results (Sleepwalker, Orphan, LW, etc). Heir will also never appear in results as Heirs are seen as villagers to info roles.,

The Bartender role itself can show up in a Bartender's results, but only if there is/was another Bartender in the game.

A Bartender who targets a player twice in a game will receive a new set of roles, following the same rules for randomized BT results.

These are the roles in the game:
